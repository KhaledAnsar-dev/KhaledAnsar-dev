## 🧠 My Learning Journey (2022–2025)

I spent 2.5 years in a rigorous self-guided curriculum guided by engineers. My learning path included:

1. **Foundational Problem Solving (C++)**
   - Solved around 300 problems covering basic to intermediate algorithms
   - Practiced 60+ structured SQL queries
   - Gained strong understanding of common data structures:
     - Lists, Dictionaries, Arrays, Queues, Stacks
     - Exposure to Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables
   - Able to apply and adapt core structures in problem-solving
     
2. **Transition to C# & Desktop Applications**
   - Built 10+ WinForms apps from scratch
   - Applied object-oriented design, separation of concerns, and clean UI design

3. **Backend Systems & Architecture**
   - Learned 3-tier/N-tier design
   - Created systems with clear BLL/DAL/UI separation
   - Introduced DTOs, service layers, and full modularity

4. **API Development & Modernization**
   - Moved to ASP.NET Core + EF Core
   - Built RESTful APIs, consumed by WinForms clients
   - Used HttpClient, async/await, DTO pipelines
